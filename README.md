# Lowest Rated Parking Lots Challenge 
A react app that finds and displays the lowest rated parking lots in a given region using the Yelp API. 

Developed with React and TailwindCSS for styling. In order to fix the CORS errors associated with the Yelp API, I've deployed an existing CORS server which you cand find [here](https://dlanesan-cors-server.herokuapp.com/).
